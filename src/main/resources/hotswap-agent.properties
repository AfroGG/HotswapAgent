# Default agent properties

# Add this classpath prior to application classpath.
# This may be useful for example in multi module maven project, where you do not need to build JAR file
# after each change.
#
# Note that the must be a plugin that will provide actual replacement such as JettyPlugin for Jetty servlet container.
extraClasspath=

# Similar to extraClasspath this property adds classpath to when searching for resources (not classes).
# While extra classpath just modifies the classloader, this setting does nothing until the resource
# is really changed.
#
# Sometimes it is not possible to point extraClasspath to your i.e. src/main/resources, because there are multiple
# replacements of resources in a building step. This setting will leave i.e. src/target/classes as default
# source for resources, but after the resource is modified in src/main/resources, the new changed resource
# is served.
